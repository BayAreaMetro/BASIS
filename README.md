# The Bay Area Spatial Information System (BASIS)
The Bay Area Spatial Information System is a long term DaaS initiative maintained and operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. This system is designed to bring key regional datasets onto an industry standard DaaS platform where users internal and external to ABAG/MTC can download it, or access it via API for analysis and modeling purposes. <b>BASIS</b> represents an evolution of past efforts, such as the Local Policy Development Survey (2005), that sought to collect data from local jurisdictions for use in regional forecasts, and long range planning activities for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area region.
